# DD2480-Group-5
This repository includes the assignments conducted in the course *DD2480 - Fundamentals of Software Engineering*. 

## Assignments
There are four assignments:
* DECIDE
* Continuous Integration
* Code Complexity & Coverage
* Issue Resolution

---

### DECIDE
This project implements a **Launch Interceptor Program** in Java. Key features include:
- **Global Variable Declarations**: Logical structures such as matrices and boolean arrays are used to handle complex decision-making processes.
- **Enums for Logical Operators**: Ensures clear and readable code when dealing with specific conditions.
- **Modular Design**: Emphasis on dependency injection to promote testability and maintainability.
- **Unit Testing with JUnit**: Comprehensive test coverage to verify the correctness of all logic and functionality.
- **Build and Test Management**: The project uses Maven for streamlined building, dependency management, and testing.

---

### Continuous Integration
The goal of this assignment is to master the core principles of **Continuous Integration (CI)** by implementing a small CI server. 

---

### Code Complexity & Coverage
The goal of this assignment is to explore **complexity and coverage metrics** by:
- Experimenting with tools to measure code complexity and coverage.
- Understanding the benefits and limitations of these metrics.
- Enhancing or creating test cases to improve **statement** or **branch coverage**.

These tasks will be performed on an open-source project of reasonable size and complexity.

---

### Issue Resolution
The goal of this assignment is to understand the complexity of issue resolution in a real project. Grading focuses on:
- The process followed to carry out the work.
- The quality of the work.
- Reflections on the work.

Even a partially resolved issue can receive full marks if it is well-managed and documented.
