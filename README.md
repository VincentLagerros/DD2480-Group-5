### DECIDE
This project implements a **Launch Interceptor Program** in Java. Key features include:
- **Global Variable Declarations**: Logical structures such as matrices and boolean arrays are used to handle complex decision-making processes.
- **Enums for Logical Operators**: Ensures clear and readable code when dealing with specific conditions.
- **Modular Design**: Emphasis on dependency injection to promote testability and maintainability.
- **Unit Testing with JUnit**: Comprehensive test coverage to verify the correctness of all logic and functionality.
- **Build and Test Management**: The project uses Maven for streamlined building, dependency management, and testing.
